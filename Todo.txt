Add incentive for castling through position values

Add nextBoard as a pointer in the Board struct. 
Add a freeBoard function to recursively free these pointers. 
Minimax will set the nextBoard of returnBoard to point to a malloc:ed version of the bestBoard. 
Add a public wrapper function for Minimax that calls freeBoard on board. 
In Minimax, remember to call FreeBoard on every board returned from Minimax that is NOT the bestBoard that we will malloc.
